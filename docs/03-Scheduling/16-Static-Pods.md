# Static Pods

- Static pods in Kubernetes are the pods that are directly managed by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, rather than being managed by the Kubernetes control plane.
- These pods are typically defined via static pod manifests located on the node's file system (default path - /etc/kubernetes/manifests) monitored by the kubelet.

#### How do you provide a pod definition file to the kubelet without a kube-apiserver?

- You can configure the kubelet to read the pod definition files from a directory on the server designated to store information about pods.

## Configure Static Pod

- The designated directory can be any directory on the host and the location of that directory is passed in to the kubelet as an option while running the service.
- The option is named as **`--pod-manifest-path`**.

## Another way to configure static pod

- Instead of specifying the option directly in the **`kubelet.service`** file, you could provide a path to another config file using the config option, and define the directory path as staticPodPath in the file.

## View the static pods

- To view the static pods
  
  ```
  $ docker ps
  ```

#### The kubelet can create both kinds of pods - the static pods and the ones from the api server at the same time.

## Static Pods - Use Case

Since static Pods are not dependent on the Kubernetes control plane, you can use static Pods `to deploy the control plane components itself as Pods on a Node.`

Well, start by installing **`kubelet`** on all the master Nodes, then create Pod definition files that uses docker images of the various control plane components such as the API server, controller, ETCD, et cetera.
Place the definition files in the designated manifest folder, and the kubelet takes care of deploying the control plane components themselves as Pods on the cluster.

This way, you don't have to download the binaries, configure services, or worry about the services crashing. If any of these services were to crash, since it's a static Pod, it'll automatically be restarted by the kubelet. That's how the kube admin tool sets up a Kubernetes cluster.
