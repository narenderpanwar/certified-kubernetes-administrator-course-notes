## Drawbacks and Limitations of NodePort and LoadBalancer

1. **Lack of Layer 7 (Application Layer) Routing**:
   NodePort and LoadBalancer operate at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) of the OSI model, meaning they can only route traffic based on IP addresses and ports. Ingress, on the other hand, operates at Layer 7, allowing for more advanced routing based on HTTP/HTTPS requests, such as URL paths and hostnames.
2. **Limited to a Single Service per Port**:
   With NodePort, each service can only be exposed on a single port across all nodes in the cluster. LoadBalancer can expose multiple services but typically requires a separate load balancer for each service. Ingress allows multiple services to be exposed through a single endpoint, providing more flexibility and efficiency.
3. **SSL Termination**:
   Ingress can handle SSL termination, allowing HTTPS traffic to be decrypted at the Ingress controller before being forwarded to the appropriate service. NodePort and LoadBalancer typically do not support SSL termination natively, requiring additional configuration or components.
4. **More Complex Configuration**:
   NodePort and LoadBalancer configurations can become cumbersome, especially as the number of services and endpoints grows. Ingress provides a more streamlined and centralized approach to managing routing rules, making it easier to maintain and scale.
5. **Limited Load Balancing Algorithms**:
LoadBalancer may offer limited options for load balancing algorithms, such as round-robin or least connections. Ingress, especially when used with a dedicated controller like NGINX or Traefik, provides more advanced load balancing capabilities, including weighted routing and session affinity.

Overall, while NodePort and LoadBalancer have their uses, especially for simple setups or when integration with external load balancers is required, Ingress offers a more feature-rich and flexible solution for managing traffic routing and SSL termination in Kubernetes clusters.
