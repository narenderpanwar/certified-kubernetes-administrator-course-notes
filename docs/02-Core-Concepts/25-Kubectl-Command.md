# Kubectl Command

In this lecture, we'll understand more about how the kubectl apply command works.

- The apply command takes into consideration the **`local configuration file`**, the **`live object definition on Kubernetes`**, and the **`last applied configuration`** before making a decision on what changes are to be made.
