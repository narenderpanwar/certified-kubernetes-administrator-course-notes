# Monitor Cluster Components

- Take me to [Video Tutuorials](https://kodekloud.com/topic/monitor-cluster-components/)

In this section, we will take a look at monitoring kubernetes cluster

#### How do you monitor resource consumption in kubernetes? or more importantly, what would you like to monitor?

## Heapster vs Metrics Server

- Heapster is now deprecated and a slimmed down version was formed known as the **`metrics server`**.
- **`Metrics server`** is a component in Kubernetes that collects resource metrics from Kubelets in a cluster. It is primarily used to provide resource utilization data such as CPU and memory usage for nodes and pods in a Kubernetes cluster. This data is crucial for monitoring and autoscaling purposes.
- Why Metrics Server is used:

1. ​**Resource Monitoring**​: Metrics Server collects resource usage metrics from every node in the cluster, providing insights into how resources such as CPU and memory are being utilized by pods and nodes.
2. ​**Autoscaling**​: Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) relies on Metrics Server to automatically scale the number of pods in a deployment or replica set based on resource utilization metrics. For example, if CPU usage exceeds a certain threshold, HPA can dynamically increase the number of pod replicas to handle the load.

## Metrics Server - Getting Started

![msg](../../images/msg.PNG)

- Clone the metric server from github repo
  
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server.git
  ```
- Deploy the metric server
  
  ```
  $ kubectl create -f metric-server/deploy/1.8+/
  ```
- View the cluster performance
  
  ```
  $ kubectl top node
  ```
- View performance metrics of pod
  
  ```
  $ kubectl top pod
  ```
